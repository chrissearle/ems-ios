        <h1>JavaZone for iOS</h1>
        
        <h2>javaBin</h2>

        <p>JavaZone is created by a group of volunteers called  <a href="http://java.no">javÂ­aBin</a>. We create the conference in our spare time. You are more than welcome to join us!</p>
        
        <h2>Development</h2>
        
        <p>Source code for this application is available <a href="https://github.com/javaBin/ems-ios/">on github</a>. The only file not provided is a plist that has integration api keys (described in README.md).</p>
        
        <h3 class="about">Issues/Support</h3>
        
        <p>If you have a problem or suggestion - then please <a href="https://github.com/javaBin/ems-ios/issues">raise an issue on github</a>. Remember to include the build version: VERSION(bBUILD).</p>
        
        <h2>Tracking and logging</h2>
        
        <p>This application has a slightly unusual usage pattern. It gets a little usage before JavaZone, it gets extremely heavy usage for two days while JavaZone is running, and it gets almost no usage until the next JavaZone is getting close. This means we have very little chance to get feedback so that we can improve it over time and need to find out what is important for the users during two days each year. That's why the app includes analytics.</p>
        
        <h3 class="about">Analytics</h3>
        
        <p>Tracking in the application logs what pages and views are open and how long data transfers are. It logs <b>no</b> personal information about you nor does it log more information about your device other than what hardware (iPhone, iPad) and what iOS version.</p>
        <p>This information will be used for two things. The main one is for working on improvements to the app itself. The other is at the end of JavaZone each year to provide an overall aggregate set of statistics on which talks was most popular (most favourited, most shared etc) to be able to make an even better conference the next year.</p>
